# Compost Tea Simulator

A sophisticated SwiftUI-based iOS application for simulating and analyzing compost tea brewing processes. This app helps users understand the complex interactions between different ingredients and their effects on microbial populations, nutrient levels, and physical properties of the brew.

## Features

### Microbial Analysis
- Real-time tracking of bacterial, fungal, and viral populations
- Species-specific microbial profiles with optimal conditions
- Metabolic and reproduction rate monitoring
- Species interaction modeling (mutualism, commensalism, parasitism, competition)
- Decomposition rate calculations

### Nutrient Analysis
- NPK ratio tracking
- Carbon:Nitrogen ratio monitoring
- Trace element analysis
- Nutrient availability calculations
- Microbial impact on nutrient release

### Physical Properties
- Moisture content monitoring
- Particle size analysis
- Bulk density calculations
- Surface area measurements
- Porosity tracking
- Environmental effects on physical properties

### Default Ingredients
- Water (5 gallons)
- Alfalfa (1 pound)
- Diatomaceous Earth (0.5 pounds)
- Molasses (5 tablespoons)
- Coffee Grounds (1 pound)
- Earthworm Castings (1 pound)
- Kelp (1 pound)
- Fish Emulsion (5 tablespoons)
